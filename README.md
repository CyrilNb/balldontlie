# balldontlie
This repository hosts the code to run www.balldontlie.io and its API.
The script to retrieve data is stored in a private repository elsewhere.

## Development
**API**   
We're using rails to run the server:   
`bundle install`  
`rails s`

**Docs**  
We're using [slate](https://github.com/lord/slate) to generate the docs page.  
`cd frontend`  
`bundle install`  
`bundle exec middleman server`  

## Data   
If you want a copy of the production data, email me at hello@balldontlie.io and I'll give you a dump. 

## Contributing    
Feel free to open any pull requests or issues.
